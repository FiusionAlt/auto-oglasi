The link is no longer functional.
You need to download XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL.

Once downloaded, put all the files inside of C:\xampp\htdocs\

After that, access phpMyAdmin from the panel by clicking on the button labeled "Admin."
From there, simply import the provided database, setup.sql, by clicking on "Import" and selecting the "setup.sql".
Press "Import" at the bottom of the page after that.

That should be it.
